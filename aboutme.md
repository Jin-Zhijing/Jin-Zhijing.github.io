[Hello world!]: #

### Are you looking for me?

I am a passionate creative with **a great love of life**. I believe in the power of ideas as a fresh impetus for technological innovation, advertising, social changes, applied art and humans' appreciation of life. 

| Fields | Skills/Talents |  
| ------ | ----------- |  
| Language | Proficient English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese. <br>Basic Japanese, German. |  
| Computer Science | C++, Shell Script, Javascript, etc. |  
| Presentation | Eloquence of speech, with effective communication skills. |  
| Visual Design | Photoshop, MS packages, Prezi, etc. |  

[With enthusiasm, I master a range of interdisciplinary skills. Instead of centring around profits and competition, I keep to a simple and boyish appreciation of life itself. My ideas have deep roots in traditional oriental art and philosophies, and the Taoism value of naturalness, a perfect state without the imprint of culture. My boundless interest in: ......helps me **to better express, to connect, to understand, to challenge, and to make changes in the world. //Through combination of ideas and skills, I wish to spread my thoughts effectively and to rouse people's thinking of how to live and why to live.**]: # ( This is a good paragraph describing my framework of life. )
