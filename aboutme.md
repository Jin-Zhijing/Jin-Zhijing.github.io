title: About me
subtitle: Jin, an Unbounded Creative with Passion
---


Hello world! I am a passionate creative with a great love of life. I believe in the power of ideas as a fresh impetus for technological innovation, advertising, social changes, applied art and humans' appreciation of life.

With enthusiasm, I master a range of interdisciplinary skills. Instead of centring around profits and competition, I keep to a simple and boyish appreciation of life itself. My ideas have deep roots in traditional oriental art and philosophies, and the Taoism value of naturalness, a perfect state without the imprint of culture. My boundless interest in:  
* Visual Design  
* Applied Programming  
* Eloquence of Speech  
* Multi-lingual Ability  
helps me **to better express, to connect, to understand, to challenge, and to make changes in the world.**

Through combination of ideas and skills, I wish to spread my thoughts effectively and to rouse people's thinking of how to live and why to live.

Are you the one looking for me?
